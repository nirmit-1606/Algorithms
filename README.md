# Algorithms

Welcome to the Algorithms repository! Here, you'll find implementations of some of the most important algorithms in computer science, along with detailed explanations and examples.

## About

This repository covers the fundamental algorithms and their implementations in Python. It is based on the content from the CS 514 course, **"Algorithms: Design, Analysis, and Implementation,"** taught by Professor **Liang Huang** at **Oregon State University**.


## Topics covered

- **Python Tutorial and Review:** Brush up on basic data structures, sorting algorithms, and selection techniques.
- **Basic Complexity Analysis:** Learn about the Master theorem, recursion tree method, amortization, and more for analyzing algorithmic complexity.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Understand how to solve complex problems efficiently using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Explore algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), topological sort, Dijkstra's algorithm, Viterbi algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- **NP-Completeness:** Delve into the theory and practice of NP-completeness in algorithmic problem-solving.
